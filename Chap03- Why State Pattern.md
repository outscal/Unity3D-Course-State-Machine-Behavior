## Why State Pattern

### Problem programmers face:

First,Â allÂ of ourÂ logicÂ is nowÂ insideÂ thisÂ single class. Â Attacking, defending, returning home, and any other state we want to createÂ allÂ need to beÂ added here. Â This will lead to a bigÂ bloated master classÂ for our AI. Â It will also make ourÂ codeÂ more likely toÂ breakÂ since weâ€™re editing the same classÂ for every type of logic. 

### State Pattern: A better approach towards implementation

A better approach is to haveÂ each stateÂ be itsÂ own class, generally with a base â€˜stateâ€™ class that they inherit from.

This way, the character or object only needs to have a reference to its current state and a call to make that state update. Â When we want to add a new state, we just create a new class.
