# What are State Machines

State machines are a concept in which a container(State) stores the status of something at any given time. Then, given an input, it can provide an output based on the current state, transitioning to a new state in the process

## What is a State Pattern

TheÂ state patternÂ is a behavioral software designÂ patternÂ that implements aÂ stateÂ machine in an object-oriented way. ThisÂ patternÂ is used in computer programming to encapsulate varying behavior for the same object based on its internalÂ state.

- A Finite State Machine consists of a finite number ofÂ states. At a given time only one such state isÂ active.
- Each state defines which state itâ€™ll transition to as anÂ output, based on the sequence ofÂ inputsÂ it receives.
- The output state becomes the new active state. In other words, aÂ state transitionÂ occurs.
