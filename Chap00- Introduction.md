## **Why State Machine Behavior?**

State Pattern is considered as a better approach towards implementation as each state (ex- enemy state) can be its own class and can inherit from a base class avoid duplicating the code.

This behaviour pattern helps in,

- Well sorted code. No switch cases in Update or anything like that.
- Small, ideally reusable StateMachineBehaviours. The state is where it is used.
- Flexible. It is rather easy to change the behaviour, even in play mode.
