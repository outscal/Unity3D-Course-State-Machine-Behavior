# Showcase to the World

## **You made it!**

Ayyyy Look who made it! Congrats on taking your first step in the industry.

Pop a bottle of champagne. Party like there is no tomorrow.

Make a lot of noise, let the world know that you have taken your first steps in the industry. Maybe have a music party with your clan members on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/R4hfXhsWjN)?

Tag us @Outscal on LinkedIn and Twitter and fill the form [here](https://airtable.com/shrXGSkgf5NClpoIU) to let us know you're worthy.

## **What next**

You can start optimizing your game (Finally!) and building Enemy AI projects by using State Machine Behavior.

Well, that's it from me on this one I guess. I will see you guys in the next one, keep building guys!
